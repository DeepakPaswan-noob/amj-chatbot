# Student Query Chatbot - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a Python Flask-based chatbot application designed to help students with academic queries. The project uses NLTK for natural language processing and SQLite for data storage.

## Key Technologies
- **Backend**: Python Flask with REST API endpoints
- **Frontend**: Modern HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with responsive design
- **Database**: SQLite for conversation storage and FAQ management
- **NLP**: NLTK for text processing and query matching
- **Styling**: CSS Grid/Flexbox with modern gradients and animations

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use Python PEP 8 standards for backend code
- Follow semantic HTML5 practices
- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- Implement responsive CSS with mobile-first approach
- Include proper error handling and user feedback

## Architecture Patterns
- RESTful API design for backend endpoints
- Modular JavaScript classes for frontend functionality
- Template-based HTML rendering with Flask
- SQLite database with proper schema design

## Key Features to Maintain
- Natural language processing for query understanding
- Real-time chat interface with typing indicators
- FAQ knowledge base with keyword matching
- Conversation history storage
- Mobile-responsive design
- Error handling and user notifications

## Development Priorities
1. **User Experience**: Smooth animations, clear feedback, intuitive interface
2. **Performance**: Efficient database queries, optimized frontend assets
3. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
4. **Scalability**: Modular code structure, easy to extend FAQ database

## When Adding New Features
- Maintain the existing design system and color scheme
- Follow the established API response format
- Add appropriate error handling
- Include mobile responsiveness
- Update the README.md documentation
- Consider database schema impacts

## Testing Considerations
- Test all API endpoints for proper error handling
- Verify responsive design across different screen sizes
- Ensure NLP matching works with various query formats
- Validate database operations and data integrity
