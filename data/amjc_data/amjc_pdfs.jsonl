This initiative supports RCC's \nSmile Stores, which collect, refurbish, and sell used clothing at affordable \nprices. The Institution contributes by gathering donations from students and \nstaff, which are then passed on to RCC for processing.

Within the college, the scheme organizes \ncampaigns to gather food grains from students and faculty. These collected \ncontributions are then channeled to the Chennai Food Bank, effectively \nconnecting the academic community with broader efforts to address food \ninsecurity in the region. \n \n \nAgurchand Manmull Jain College                                  Hand-Book 2024-2025 \n \n \n51 \n \nCHOICE BASED CREDIT SYSTEM \n \nContent of CBCS: \n \n❖ From the academic year 2008-2009, the University of Madras introduced \nthe Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) with Semester Pattern. At both \nthe under -graduate and post -graduate levels, each course of study is  \nassigned a certain number of credits, and a student who obtains the  \nrequired number of credits over the study period is considered as having \ncompleted the course and upon that he/she is awarded the degree. \nFurther, at the under-graduate level, a student of a major course of study \nhas the choice to select a subje ct that he/she would like to learn (other \nthan the  major subject) within the prescribed time period and the \nprogramme parameters. The non -major elective subject also carries a \ncertain credit. As per the course curriculum, a non-Tamil student has to \nstudy Basic Tamil or Advanced Tamil (as the case may be) instead of the \nnon-major elective subject. \n❖ Apart from this, the course curriculum requires the student to take up \nfour skill-based subjects, known as Soft Skills, in order to improve \nhis/her employability. Moreover, the curriculum seeks to make the \nstudent aware of the environment in which he/she is living, and intends \nto develop the student as a wholesome personality by inculcating values \nin him/her. Thus, the course curriculum includes Environmental Studies \nand Value Education. In short, the course curriculum as designed by the \nUniversity of Madras seeks to mould and shape the student in such a \nway that he/ she while leaving the portals of the educational institution \nwill not only be knowledgeable and employable, but responsible too.  \n \n \nThe broad outlines of the Choice Based Credit System are as follows: \n \n• Part I         : Tamil/other Languages \n• Part II    : English \n• Part III (a) :  2 Major Subjects \n• Part III (b) :  1 Allied Subject \n• Part IV (a)  :  Non-Major Elective or Basic Tamil/Advanced Tamil \n• Part IV (b)  :  Soft Skills/Environmental Studies/ Value Education/  \n      Skill Enhancement Programme \n• Part V    :  Extension Activities. \n \nAgurchand Manmull Jain College                                  Hand-Book 2024-2025 \n \n \n52 \n \nDURATION OF THE SEMESTERS: \n \n• Each academic year shall be divided into two semesters.

People have become increasingly insensitive to the \nsuffering of fellow beings and much more insensitive to other living beings. \nAlbert Einstein once said, if bees, honey bees, very small little living beings are\n extinct, within four years whole of human race will get extinct. This sentence \nhammers that survival of human beings is possible, only if we have these little \nbeings. These small creatures are tirelessly doing the job of pollination of \ncrops, herbal plants and trees. Now due to the excessive use of fertilizers and \npesticides, it is reported that these honey bees losing their memory power and \nare struggling to return to their hives. They could survive only in groups, if we \ncontinue to use chemicals, if we continue to do the blunder of ignoring these \nsmall little workers, really, we don’t have any other alternate, for the work that \nthey only can do. That is the work of pollination. Because of the increased \nnumber of networking towers, we lost our small little sparrows. It is reported \nthat number of crows are declining.

Explain in 500\nwords\n  \nAgurchand Manmull Jain College is a Co-educational aided and Self financing\ninstitution offering wide varieties of programmes to students promoting\nInclusive and Holistic Education. Based on students demand and the changing\nrequirement of the society new programmes are offered. The College introduced\ntwo Under Graduate programmes (BA- Tamil and BA- Defence and Strategic Studies)\nand M.Sc Maths- A Post Graduate Program in the AY 2019-2020 along with existing\nUG and PG programmes. Effective curriculum delivery is ensured with a\nsystematic Teaching-learning Process. A well planned calendar prepared ahead,\nensures smooth conduct of various departments and club activities. At the\nbeginning of every semester based on expertise of faculty and preference\nsubjects are allotted and staff workload is agreed mutually in the department.\nTime tables are prepared for both practical and theory exams and shared to\nstudents which are also displayed in notice boards. For implementation of\ncurriculum, teachers have included teaching methods such as presentation,\nassignments, and seminars for effective teaching. Timely meeting are conducted\nand instruction are given for submission of assignments and conducting unit\ntest and internal test are well planned and executed before final examination.\nTwo Internal assessments for one hour each per subject are conducted in both\nthe odd and even semesters of the year to evaluate the acquired knowledge of\nthe students in the subjects taught. Also, centralized model examinations of 3\nhours duration are conducted to check the readiness of the students to appear\nfor the University examinations. Besides this, periodical assignments are given\nby the respective subject-in-charges to assess the level of understanding in\nthe respective subjects. Digital learning materials such as eBooks and\nelectronic documents (Word docs, PDFs) are given to the students to facilitate\nlearning. Remedial Classes are conducted to those students who needed it. The\nclasses were conducted before the start of the regular class sessions in order\nto not hinder the regular classes. Special care and attention is given to the\nslow learners by circulating Question Bank with answers in pdf format for each\nsubject comprising the important repeated questions based on previous year\nUniversity Exam question papers (prepared by respective subject-in-charge).\nEffective curriculum delivery is ensured by regular conduct of classes,\nassignments, expert tables, Guest lecturer and seminar. Industrial visits,\nfield project, workshop enhance students learning experience. Internships offer\nstudent a real time experience which enables better understanding of what has\nbeen taught. Student mentoring system, parent teacher association and\ncounseling services result in better student understanding and develop cordial\nrelation between faculty and student. The increase in number of Rank holders\nand students securing high marks in University examination serves as an\nevidence of effectiveness in curriculum delivery.\n 1.1.2 – Certificate/ Diploma Courses introduced during the academic year\n  Certificate Diploma Courses Dates of\nIntroduction\nDuration Focus on employ\nability/entreprene\nurship\nSkill\nDevelopment\n  NA   NA   Nil   0   NA   NA\n1.2 – Academic Flexibility\n 1.2.1 – New programmes/courses introduced during the academic year\n  Programme/Course Programme Specialization Dates of Introduction\n  BA   TAMIL   24/05/2019\n  BA   DEFENCE & STRATEGIC\nSTUDIES\n  24/05/2019\n  MSc   MATHEMATICS   24/05/2019\n    View Uploaded File\n 1.2.2 – Programmes in which Choice Based Credit System (CBCS)/Elective course system implemented at the\naffiliated Colleges (if applicable) during the academic year.\n  Name of programmes adopting\nCBCS\nProgramme Specialization Date of implementation of\nCBCS/Elective Course System\n  MSc   MATHEMATICS   24/05/2019\n  BA   DEFENCE STRATEGIC\nSTUDIES\n  24/05/2019\n  BA   TAMIL   24/05/2019\n 1.2.3 – Students enrolled in Certificate/ Diploma Courses introduced during the year\n  Certificate Diploma Course\nNumber of Students\n  0   0\n1.3 – Curriculum Enrichment\n 1.3.1 – Value-added courses imparting transferable and life skills offered during the year\n  Value Added Courses Date of Introduction Number of Students Enrolled\n  COMPUTERISED ACCOUNTING   09/01/2020   421\n  PHYTHON   09/01/2020   215\n  EVENT MANAGEMENT   09/01/2020   47\n  HARDWARE NETWORKING   09/01/2020   69\n  LOGISTICS SCM   09/01/2020   63\n  ADVANCED EXCEL   09/01/2020   91\n    View Uploaded File\n 1.3.2 – Field Projects / Internships under taken during the year\n  Project/Programme Title Programme Specialization No. of students enrolled for Field\nProjects / Internships\n  BCom   CORPORATE   331\n  BCom   MARKETING MANAGEMENT   48\n  BCom   INFO & SYSTEM\nMANAGEMENT\n  114\n  BSc   VISCOM   100\n  MSc   VISCOM   21\n  MCom   COMMERCE   44\n  MSc   MATHS   18\n  MSc   PHYSICS   8\n  MSc   CHEMISTRY   11\n  MA   ECONOMICS   3\n    View Uploaded File\n1.4 – Feedback System\n 1.4.1 – Whether structured feedback received from all the stakeholders.\n  Students   Yes\nTeachers   No\nEmployers   No\nAlumni   Yes\nParents   Yes\n 1.4.2 – How the feedback obtained is being analyzed and utilized for overall development of the institution?\n(maximum 500 words)\n  Feedback Obtained\nThe college has implemented various measures to constantly monitor, review and\nimprove the performance of its various stake holders (like, students, alumni,\nparents and employers).

Give details. (maximum 500 words)\n  The college has been consistently striving to uphold academic standards and moral values through several\nmeasures. As have new departments been added over the time, so have the initiatives to enhance and sustain\nthe quality of the academic perspectives and student-centric aspects. In order to closely monitor the holistic\ndevelopment of the students, the Mentor-Mentee system has been put in place. Through the Mentor-Mentee\nsystem, networks are carefully created, each headed by a staff member of the respective departments. A\nselected number of students are placed under the guidance of the Mentor. All facets of every student – curricular,\nco-curricular and extra-curricular – are closely and continuously monitored, recorded and reviewed by the\nMentor. With respect to the academic-based performance of the student, the marks obtained in every subject, for\nevery test, assignment and exam are recorded. The student’s progress is tabulated and calibrated for regular\nupdates. As the Mentor has access to the mentee’s continuous performance, the monitoring is complete, total\nand hence effective. Being in close proximity of the student’s performance, the Mentor takes the responsibility to\nscrutinise, guide and motivate the student. It also becomes the Mentor’s prerogative to bridge the lacuna, if any,\nbetween the student and the members of the faculty, should there arise any setback in the teaching-learning\nprocess. Corrective measures are brought in by the respective staff members after discussions with the staff -in-\ncharge who acts as the specific student’s mentor. As this approach of intensified and broad-spectrum coverage\nof the student’s performance is systematically undertaken, the student benefits unconditionally. It is to be noted\nthat the role of the Mentor does not cease with the academic monitoring. The student is encouraged to approach\nthe respective Mentor for every issue faced within the campus and with relevance to the holistic growth of the\nstudent. Thus, it is a common practice that the Mentee seeks the help, guidance and motivation from the Mentor\nin matters that concern the overall upliftment of the students. As a large number of students of the college come\nfrom the underprivileged section of the society and also a major part of them being first generation learners, this\nsystem helps to put the student community in the right track. The Mentor-Mentee scheme thus acts as a powerful\ntool in ensuring a result-oriented growth. In order to extend the benefits of this system, the college puts in to\npractice another course of action: regular meetings with the parents. Since the parents too are stakeholders in\ncompleting the holistic growth of the students, they are periodically invited to the respective departments on the\nspecified date and time for regular updates about their ward. They are briefed about the progress, achievements,\nand setbacks, if any, and inclusive discussions and initiated. The outcome of these meetings is marked by the\nstudent being carefully guided and encouraged by the parents as the latter are well informed about their wards.\nThe Mentor-Mentee system and the regular parents’ meet fortify the teaching-learning process.\n  Number of students enrolled in the\ninstitution\nNumber of fulltime teachers Mentor : Mentee Ratio\n  9021   334   1:27\n2.4 – Teacher Profile and Quality\n 2.4.1 – Number of full time teachers appointed during the year\n  No. of sanctioned\npositions\nNo. of filled positions Vacant positions Positions filled during\nthe current year\nNo. of faculty with\nPh.D\n  353   334   19   71   117\n 2.4.2 – Honours and recognition received by teachers (received awards, recognition, fellowships at State, National,\nInternational level from Government, recognised bodies during the year )\n  Year of Award Name of full time teachers\nreceiving awards from\nstate level, national level,\ninternational level\nDesignation Name of the award,\nfellowship, received from\nGovernment or recognized\nbodies\n  2019   Ms. S.

They are Seminars,\nAssignments, Students Attendance and three internal evaluations (two monthly\ntests and the model examination that follows the question paper pattern of the\nensuing University examinations). In order to raise the bar of the academic\nstandards and to instill a renewed interest in the subject, several additional\nevaluation techniques are undertaken. All the end of the completion of each\nunit, different methodologies of evaluation are followed by individual faculty\nmembers: 1. The students are engaged in group discussions, with the teaching\nfaculty member initiating various topics that lead to the participation of the\nstudents with different points of view 2. Debates are encouraged wherein the\ninputs from the students could reflect the level of their comprehension of the\ncompleted unit. Alongside the evaluation, this facilitates an indirect\nexperience to the needy students. 3. Some departments assign simple projects to\nstudents individually or in groups to make a PowerPoint presentation or a video\npresentation with facts and additional information as a supplement or to\nvalidate the points covered in the completed unit. 4. The understanding\ncapacity of the students in assessed and they are given assignments accordingly\nto apply the concept in solving the problems of the real time scenario. 5.\nWhile the students make a presentation, various factors are considered to\nevaluate based on the Topic introduction and subject introduction,\nCommunication skills, Presentation skills, Illustration in real-time and\nConclusion.\n 2.5.3 – Academic calendar prepared and adhered for conduct of Examination and other related matters (250\nwords)\n  \nThe members of the Calendar Committee prepare the ensuing academic year’s\ncalendar taking all relevant parameters into consideration. Care is taken to\nconsider the length of the prescribed Units and hence suggestions of the Heads\nof the Departments and Coordinators are considered so that the members of the\nrespective departments may be instructed to frame their lesson plans\naccordingly. With this initiative as the cornerstone, the dates for the\ncontinuous internal evaluation are decided and earmarked in the academic\ncalendar. The other crucial parameters such as national and regional holidays,\nreligious festivals and community events (the college being a Jain minority\ninstitution) are also duly taken into close consideration. The Heads of the\nDepartments and Coordinators monitor the completion of the Unit within the time\nframe and this is brought to the notice of the Principal and the Dean. Upon\nthese coordinated efforts, the students are notified about the date of the CIE\ntests as printed in the college calendar. Thus the college strictly adheres to\nthe academic calendar for the conduct of the CIE except in the rare and\nunavoidable cases such as a holiday declared owing to the demise of a national\nleader or an unforeseen natural calamity.\n2.6 – Student Performance and Learning Outcomes\n 2.6.1 – Program outcomes, program specific outcomes and course outcomes for all programs offered by the\ninstitution are stated and displayed in website of the institution (to provide the weblink)\n  \nhttp://www.amjaincollege.edu.in/images/iqac/COURSE-OUTCOME.pdf\n 2.6.2 – Pass percentage of students\n  Programme\nCode\nProgramme\nName\nProgramme\nSpecialization\nNumber of\nstudents\nappeared in the\nfinal year\nexamination\nNumber of\nstudents passed\nin final year\nexamination\nPass Percentage\n  ADA   BA   Economics   104   103   99\n    View Uploaded File\n2.7 – Student Satisfaction Survey\n 2.7.1 – Student Satisfaction Survey (SSS) on overall institutional performance (Institution may design the\nquestionnaire) (results and details be provided as weblink)\n  \n   http://www.amjaincollege.edu.in/images/file/Students-Feedback-\nAnalysis-2019-20.pdf \nCRITERION III – RESEARCH, INNOVATIONS AND EXTENSION\n3.1 – Resource Mobilization for Research\n 3.1.1 – Research funds sanctioned and received from various agencies, industry and other organisations\n  Nature of the Project Duration Name of the funding\nagency\nTotal grant\nsanctioned\nAmount received\nduring the year\n  Nill   0   NIL   0   0\n    View Uploaded File\n3.2 – Innovation Ecosystem\n 3.2.1 – Workshops/Seminars Conducted on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and Industry-Academia Innovative\npractices during the year\n  Title of workshop/seminar Name of the Dept.

They are Students’ Development Council (for Shift – I)\nand Students Welfare Council (for Shift-II). For both the student bodies, the\nPrincipal is the president and faculty members from various departments are the\nvice presidents.All the students are ispo facto members of the college\nStudent’s Development Council / Student Welfare Council. The students of the\ncollege get represented by their respective class representatives. The students\nare screened at several levels such as sound academic performance with nil\narrears, extracurricular and sports achievements so as to be eligible to\nparticipate in the elections.Panels are formed with members from various\ndepartments to oversee the election process. Gender equality is ensured amongst\nthe office bearers for the SDC and SWC as they are represented by boys and\ngirls in equal numbers. In total, there are eight of them, viz., Chairpersons,\nVice-Chairpersons, Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. They hold the office\nfor one academic year. These members report to the Principal/Dean through the\nfaculty who are the council members of SDC/SWC. Hence the active involvement\nand dedicational spirit among the members of the said councilsthrough the\neffective involvement of the faculty associated with the council continue to\nuphold the institution’s prestige through their various activities . The\nStudent Development Council and the Student Welfare Council have taken the\ninitiative of SEED practices to implement and strengthen the quality of\nentrepreneurial ability and the leadership qualities of the prospective\nstudents. The hidden potential and capabilities of the students are brought out\nthrough activities such as AMJCIAN BAZAR, AAVIN and PUSTHAK BHARATH. Further,\nthe SDC and SWC play an active role by organizing cultural activities thereby\nfacilitating an orderly relationship between the students, faculty and the\nManagement.\n5.4 – Alumni Engagement\n 5.4.1 – Whether the institution has registered Alumni Association?\n Yes\n  Rich in experience while strong in their academic roots, the past students are\npioneers of their alma matar. Acknowledging this fact, our college taps the\nimmense potential of the alumni by inviting them to play a major part in the\ncollege program so as to inspire, motivate and enlighten the student community.\nMany of the alumni now are established entrepreneurs, businessmen and employers\noffering job opportunities to vast number of job seekers. The members of Alumni\nAssociation belong to a variety of domains- social, administrative, academic,\ncorporate, governmental, legal, medical, engineering and several more. It has\nbeen a matter of joy and fulfillment that the alumni introduce the members of\ntheir family during the Alumni Meet, and it is a tradition that continues.\nCatalyst in inciting the institution’s development, the community of the alumni\nshares their practical experiences. They offer constructive, practical and\nproductive ideas. The administrative body of the college values these inputs,\nanalyses and continues to put in its efforts in incorporating them. Standing\nout and standing tall, the college strictly follows the policy ‘NO DONATION, NO\nCAPITATION’ ever since its inception. Thus as the noble outcome of the unique\npolicy, the long list of the alumni from such a vast expanse of fields speaks\nfor itself. It is also noteworthy that the Secretary, the Principal, several\nHeads of the Departments and Faculty members (Teaching Non- Teaching) of the\ncollege are proud members of the Alumni Association, even as they continue to\nwork towards the growth of their alma matar.\n 5.4.2 – No. of enrolled Alumni:\n  \n850\n 5.4.3 – Alumni contribution during the year (in Rupees) :\n  \n0\n 5.4.4 – Meetings/activities organized by Alumni Association :\n  \n1 ALUMNI MEETING\nCRITERION VI – GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT\n6.1 – Institutional Vision and Leadership\n 6.1.1 – Mention two practices of decentralization and participative management during the last year (maximum 500\nwords)\n  \nDecentralization practices: It reflects the policy decision making, planning\nand administration, and office management.

The college has its own internal audit mechanism where internal\naudit is an ongoing continuous process in addition to the external Institute\neach year. To examine the day-to-day account transactions of the college and\nreports the audit findings to the Management on periodic basis, qualified\nInternal Auditors from external resources have been permanently appointed and a\nteam of staff under them do a thorough check and verification of all vouchers\nof the transactions that are carried out in each financial year and looks after\ndaily opening balance, receipts (fee collections), payment vouchers and\ncollections. These payment vouchers and receipts are recorded in cash book and\nis brought to external audit wing. The Internal Auditor prepares Audit Note\nBook and Query notes for effective verification of records. The above documents\nare also updated at external audit office. To strengthen this process, purchase\ninvoice bills, Annual maintenance bills, verification of quotations and\nproposals are done and submitted to higher authority for the approval of\npayment. After verifying stock entries by the Internal Auditor and also after\nthe approval of the authorized authority the accounts of the respective vendors\nare settled. To maintain the accuracy and appropriateness of the financial\ntransactions for the smooth functioning of the College, such regular audits\nfocus in containing the weaknesses of the existing financial system, fraud or\nabuse if any. The internal audit system also paves the way for error-free\nmaintenance of the College accounts and facilitates effective conduct of\nexternal audit. The external audit is also undertaken on quarterly basis in the\nAdministrative Office to examine the financial records and statements of the\nCollege to verify the fair scrutiny of financial documents. The external audit\nexamines the necessary bills, the collection receipts, vouchers, bank statement\nentries, routine journal and contra entries, TDS recovery details, salary and\nsalary deduction details, etc., In addition, verification is also done for the\nPF and ESI submissions, review of the credit of the fixed deposit interest,\nnecessary Challan generations, TDS calculations, etc. The accounts staff\nprepare and submit the Final Accounts and the Statement of Income for the\nexternal audit which is finalized and approved after filing of Income Tax\nreturns. All the opinions, comments and suggestions provided during external\naudit process are duly considered by the Management for the effective and\nefficient functioning of the financial administration in the forthcoming\nfinancial years. So far there have been no major findings / objections. Minor\nerrors of omissions and commissions when pointed out by the audit team are\nimmediately corrected / rectified and precautionary steps are taken to avoid\nrecurrence of such errors in future. The institute regularly follows Internal\nexternal financial audit system.\n 6.4.2 – Funds / Grants received from management, non-government bodies, individuals, philanthropies during the\nyear(not covered in Criterion III)\n  Name of the non government\nfunding agencies /individuals\nFunds/ Grnats received in Rs.

Solar Energy Usage and LED usage The College makes use of a Solar Energy\nunit as an alternative energy resource. The ladies hostel makes use of a solar\nwater heater and the College has taken steps to replace conventional light\nbulbs to LED-bulbs as part of Green Initiatives. 2. Plastic free campus and\nPaperless office: The campus is declared as a plastic-free area. Use of plastic\nbags and cups (below 50micron) are prohibited inside the campus. In the\ncanteens stainless steel plates and cups are encouraged. Measures are taken to\nspread the awareness about the hazards of plastic. The College has taken steps\ntowards making the office a paperless one. 3. Rain water harvesting The College\nhas rainwater harvesting facilities within the main building as well as the\ncampus area near the Gyan Bhavan building. 4. Green landscaping with trees and\nplants: More than 50 of total area is covered with trees and lawns. The Garden\nand lawns are maintained by the Estate Department under vigilant supervision.\nAs a part of the Green initiatives, the students were encouraged to go in for\norganic farming and as a pilot project this was carried out within the college\ncampus. 5. Public Transport Awareness: A large portion of the students and\nfaculty members use public transportation for commutation. The campus is well\nconnected with local rail service and public bus service. The campus has wide,\nwell-maintained precast concrete block pavement roads. Parking areas are\nprovided and marked. 6. Waste Management: The Institution has eco-friendly\nmethods of waste management. a) Solid Waste management: The College disposes\nthe solid waste generated in the campus, in a planned and systematic manner\nwith the help of a private agency and the Corporation of Chennai. The waste\ngenerated is segregated as biodegradable and non-biodegradable. The pit is of\n12 feet deep and of 5 feet radius. The rest of the biodegradable waste and non-\nbiodegradable waste are collected in dustbins and hand over to the\nCorporation’s trash management system. The College treats human solid waste in\ntwo different ways. One is by using the septic tanks and the second one is by\nusing the Corporation’s drainage system. The College has 3 septic tanks within\nthe campus. b) Liquid Waste management: The College has adopted recycling\ntechniques to partially manage the liquid waste. The College has six RO water\ntreatment plants for drinking purpose. Every one part of RO water purified\nthree parts of untreated water is being produced as waste. This waste water\n(approx.45,000 lts per a day) is recycled and used in toilets and garden. c) E-\nwaste management: The E-wastes which are available in the campus like\nkeyboards, monitors, hard drives, cables, printers IC’S, PCB etc., are managed\nin carefully planned ways: E-waste generated is utilized as study materials for\nthe students in the computer lab under the supervision of faculty members. The\ncondemned batteries and damaged computers and other e-waste material\n7.2 – Best Practices\n 7.2.1 – Describe at least two institutional best practices\n  \n1. Scholarships: Scholarships are awarded to the economically weaker section of\nthe students. As per the vision of the College, economically weaker section of\nthe students are provided with scholarships. This helps these students to\nconcentrate on studies rather than availing a part-time job for economical\nsupport. 2. Padma Shri. Mohanmullji Chordia Book Bank Scheme: Emancipation\nthrough knowledge is the guiding principle of the College. The comprehensive\nbook bank scheme is introduced to cater deserving students’ urge for quality\neducation. Quality text books are unaffordable for some students. Such students\nare identified and are made part of the Book Bank Scheme. Padma Shri.\nMohanmullji Chordia Book Bank Scheme is in operation since 2012-13 Academic\nyear. Deserving students are given books for all the subjects of the semester.\nBooks given under the scheme can be used by the students during that particular\nsemester, and they return the books to the library at the end of the semester.\n3. SEED CELL: Aiming at promoting entrepreneurial skills among the students in\nthe college, an initiative called ‘Students Empowerment and Entrepreneurship\nDevelopment cell’ (SEED CELL) has being created. It aims to give students hands-\non experience in entrepreneurship. Two initiatives Ksheera Sagar (Aavin\nparlour) and Pustak Bharathi (Stationary Shop) are run by the students. The\nmanagement has provided sufficient infrastructure facilities and capital for\nthe initiatives. As part of SEED initiatives, to make the students understand\nand experience the entrepreneurial possibilities, a programme called ‘AMJCian\nBAAZAR’ is instituted. Infrastructure (space, power and furniture) have been\nprovided free of cost for the students to put up their stalls inside the\ncampus. 4. SMART GIRL: As a part of women empowerment programme, the college\nhas initiated a programme called ‘SMART GIRL’, to impart training among girl\nstudents to build self-confidence and self- esteem. Faculty members have got\nhands on training at the ‘Smart Girl’ workshop to conduct the programme. 5. JOY\nOF GIVING: As a part of social commitment, the College has initiated a program\ncalled ‘JOY OF GIVING’. Inmates of an orphanage were invited to the college and\nwere provided with educational aids. They spent the whole day in the college\ncampus. Fun games and other events were organised. 6. ICT Academy Membership:\nThe college is a member of ICT Academy which is a joint venture under State-\nCentre and private partnership (public-private partnership). This academy\narranges Seminars and Faculty training workshops and Students training\nworkshops. 7. TCS Training: The corporate Giant TCS under its CSR programme\nprovides training for the final year students at the end of which the selected\nstudents are absorbed by TCS. The College is one of the first Colleges to\nreceive this programme in the city of Chennai, 2018-19 being the nineth\nsuccessive academic year. 8. Creche Facility: The College has started crèche\nfacility for the young children of the Teaching and Non-Teaching staff members\nas a part of Employee welfare measures.\n  Upload details of two best practices successfully implemented by the institution as per NAAC format in your\ninstitution website, provide the link\nhttp://www.amjaincollege.edu.in/\n7.3 – Institutional Distinctiveness\n 7.3.1 – Provide the details of the performance of the institution in one area distinctive to its vision, priority and\nthrust in not more than 500 words\n  \nRooted in its core value, guided by its vision, the college caters to the\nsocially and economically underprivileged people. Being a Jain minority College\nand in line with the Jain philosophy, ‘Parasparopagraho Jivanam’ – ‘The\nfunction of the soul is to help one another’, the College has for motto, ‘Sa\nVidhya Ya Vimuktaya’ – ‘Knowledge leads to Liberation’, an optimal blend of\nspirituality and education. Established in 1952 to serve the needy, exclusively\nin the field of higher education, at a time when it was out of bounds for the\nunderprivileged, the founders envisaged the fruition of the objective: the\nVision of the College was set thus – ‘To be a disseminator of quality multi-\ndisciplinary higher education that is affordable among all learners in general\nand among Jain students in particular.’ - the institutional distinctiveness, by\npropagating education irrespective of caste, creed or social standing. With the\nsteadily growing number of students and shifting to its own campus of a massive\nforty-two acres in Meenambakkam. The College deputes a teaching faculty member\nevery year exclusively to oversee the distribution of the official forms of the\nbus pass and railways pass, made available to them at concessional rates by the\nGovernment. A veritable boon to the less-affluent, Padmashri. Mohanmullji\nChordia Book Bank Scheme continues to serve since several decades. The hostel\nfacility was introduced with all necessary infrastructure for a safe and\ncomfortable accommodation for the needy students at a nominal cost. In the\nacademic year 2003-2004, the College opened its doors to the girl students. A\ncommon room exclusively for the girls, Women Students Welfare Committee,\nGrievance Redressal Cell – Counselling and Guidance (girls), a separate hostel\nfor girl students are some of the timely efforts that were promptly taken. New\nDegree programmes are periodically incorporated to stay abreast with the\nchanging needs of the society. As the prime policy of the College’s Management,\n‘No Donation’ and ‘No Capitation Fee’, students from every walk of life enrol\nthemselves to the Degree programmes. The poor economic background not being\ndeterrent in the academic accomplishment, large number of the College’s past\nstudents have reached the pinnacle of the social strata – from being supreme\ncourt advocates, to IAS officers, to social scientists, to entrepreneurs. An\nexploration of the economic background of the students enrolled over the years\nis an eye-opener to the College’s distinctiveness. Majority of the students\nhail from socially and economically backward families, most of them the first-\ngeneration learners. The students irrespective of their economic background, as\nin every case, are given training in carrier guidance and also benefit from an\nactive placement cell.
