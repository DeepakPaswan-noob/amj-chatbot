Jain Educational Society)\n(Affiliated to the University of Madras)\nMeenambakkam, Chennai – 600 061.\nSince its inception, Agurchand Manmull Jain College has been fostering human values. Guided by the Jain principles of Samabhavana (equanimity) and Parasparopagraho Jivanam (mutual upliftment), we imbue our students with these profound values. This has evolved into the KRIYA initiative: Knowledge Rooted in Indian Traditions for Youthful Awakening. Aligned with the UGC’s Mulya Pravah framework, KRIYA encapsulates our approach to cultivating values, skills, and holistic development by integrating Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) into the campus life, curricular and co-curricular activities.\nPurpose of KRIYA\nKRIYA aims to combine ancient wisdom with modern education, shaping students who are academically skilled, ethically grounded, and culturally aware.\n- Cultural Foundation: Foster a deep appreciation for India’s cultural heritage, ensuring students remain rooted in tradition while adapting modern complexities.\n- Ethical Living: Promote integrity, empathy, and social responsibility, guiding students to live value-based lives.\n- 21st Century Preparedness: Equip students with critical thinking, practical skills, resilience, and the ethical foundation necessary to thrive in a competitive, interconnected world.\nSignificance of KRIYA\n- Cultural Relevance: IKS offers contextual understanding of knowledge that resonates with the cultural backgrounds of students, fostering deeper engagement and retention.\n- Holistic Development: KRIYA addresses intellectual, emotional, and social dimensions, shaping well-rounded individuals contributing positively to society.\n- Global Competitiveness: IKS provides students with unique perspectives that enhance their adaptability and innovation.\nObjectives of KRIYA\n- Holistic Education: Integrate Indian Knowledge Systems into curricular and co-curricular activities to provide a culturally rich, well-rounded education.\n- Character Building and Community Engagement: Foster students’ ethics, values, and social responsibility in alignment with Mulya Pravah 2.0, by promoting active participation in community service and sustainability initiatives, encouraging a culture of sharing, environmental consciousness, and social commitment.\n- Skill Development: Enhance students’ competencies and attitudes for personal and professional success.\nFramework of KRIYA\n- Cultural Integration through IKS:\nIndian values and knowledge systems are integrated into the academic and co-curricular framework. Practices like Yoga, Meditation, Bhakthamara Stotra recitation, Hindi Diwas, Valarthamizh Mandram, and Sinthanai Kalam offer students a deep connection with Indian traditions. IKS from philosophy, sciences, and arts are integrated into value-added courses. All roads, and infrastructure are named resonating Indian history and IKS. The institution has CRIKS (Centre for Reviving Indian Knowledge System) and Arham Gyan Kendra to foster exploration and dissemination of traditional knowledge and spiritual practices.\n- Experiential and Value-Based Learning:\nStudents engage in projects that apply traditional knowledge to modern-day challenges. Initiatives like organic farming and sustainable waste management are facilitated through Karuna Club and Enviro Club. Mulya Pravah 2.0 is embedded in workshops and activities that focus on ethics, social responsibility, and character building. Through skill-based courses, training programs, and events under ED Cell, Sardar, AMJCian Bazaar, and Ahaaram traditional food festival enhance the student’s employability and entrepreneurial skills.\n- Community and Environmental Engagement:\nKRIYA emphasizes real-world learning through outreach programs focused on rural development, environmental conservation, and social justice. Students actively engage in community services, campaigns, and extension activities that promote empathy, leadership, and social responsibility. Initiatives like Joy of Giving reinforce these values, while sustainability projects and green campus initiatives nurture environmental consciousness.\nOutcomes of KRIYA\n- Enhanced Academic Performance:\nThe KRIYA initiative has resulted in a measurable improvement in academic performance. The overall pass percentage increased from 49.49 % in 2018 to 81.66 % in 2024, highlighting the successful integration of Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS), Human Values, and experiential learning into the curriculum. The initiative also boosted students’ engagement in value-added courses, MOOCs, and curricular projects such as Thadam, reflecting a well-rounded academic growth.\n- Increased Cultural Awareness:\nKRIYA has deepened students’ understanding and appreciation of India’s cultural heritage. All students and staff participated in one or more of the cultural workshops, events, seminars, or research projects that explored aspects of Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) and human values. These activities fostered greater cultural sensitivity and have been reflected in the completion of projects, publications, and research related to IKS.\n- Stronger Community Ties:\nKRIYA has significantly increased students’ engagement in community service. Through community outreach programs, students have impacted over 4 villages and 100 households, contributing to improvements in literacy, healthcare, and sustainability. The increase in the number of extension and outreach programs from 22 in 2019 to 58 in 2024 is a testament to the institution’s stronger community engagement.\n- Publications, Partnerships, and MoUs:\nThe initiative has led to the establishment of key collaborations, partnerships, and MoUs with national and international organizations. These partnerships have facilitated increased awareness in the college community and strengthened our commitment to community outreach and knowledge sharing.\n- Alignment with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nKRIYA aligns with multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 2: Zero Hunger and Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being. Through projects like organic farming and waste management and grain donation campaign – Samarakshana, students contribute to food security and healthier living environments. For instance, the Biogas Plant initiative led to a 90 % reduction in food waste output on campus, promoting a more sustainable community.\n- Student Transformation through Character Building\nThe ethical and value-based foundation of KRIYA has significantly impacted students’ personal development. Participation in programs like the Joy of Giving, Aadaidhanam, Samarakshana, and sustainability initiatives has fostered empathy, humility, and social justice among students. A survey shows that over 60% of students consider community service and social responsibility essential to their lives.\n7 Holistic Development:\nKRIYA promotes the holistic development of students and they develop as responsible citizens committed to environmental sustainability, social justice, and ethical leadership. A survey based on ISO 45003 indicates that more than 60% of students have high psychosocial behaviour related to communication, teamwork, leadership skills, and values such as non-violence, compassion, and mutual respect.\nBy nurturing cultural awareness, ethical values, practical skills, and academic excellence, KRIYA prepares students to become responsible citizens and capable professionals. Through this initiative, we reaffirm our commitment to creating a compassionate and intellectually vibrant community, rooted in the institution’s vision and mission.
