# NOTE: Heavy ML packages (transformers, sentence-transformers, tokenizers, torch,
# torchvision, accelerate) have been moved to `requirements-ml.txt` because
# some hosts (like Render) cannot compile Rust extensions during the build.
# If you need them on a machine with the Rust toolchain or prebuilt wheels,
# install them separately with:
#   pip install -r requirements-ml.txt

# (Optional) numpy explicitly if needed
