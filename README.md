## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Project Structure

```
STUDENT-CHATBOT/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ chatbot.db            # SQLite database (auto-created)
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html        # Main chat interface
â””â”€â”€ static/
    â”œâ”€â”€ css/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css     # Styling and animations
    â””â”€â”€ js/
        â””â”€â”€ script.js     # Frontend functionality
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Natural Language Processing**
The chatbot uses NLTK to:
- Tokenize user input
- Remove stop words
- Lemmatize words for better matching
- Score similarity between queries and FAQ entries

### 2. **Knowledge Base Matching**
- Preprocesses both user queries and FAQ content
- Uses word overlap scoring to find best matches
- Falls back to general help when no specific match is found

### 3. **Conversation Storage**
- All conversations are stored in SQLite database
- Enables analytics and improvement of responses
- Maintains conversation history

## Customization

### Adding New FAQs
You can add new FAQs by modifying the `default_faqs` list in `app.py`:

```python
{
    "question": "Your question here?",
    "answer": "Your detailed answer here.",
    "category": "category_name",
    "keywords": "relevant keywords for matching"
}
```

### Styling Customization
Modify `static/css/style.css` to change:
- Color schemes
- Layout and spacing
- Animations and effects
- Responsive behavior

### Adding New Features
The modular structure allows easy addition of:
- New API endpoints in `app.py`
- Frontend features in `script.js`
- Database schema changes
- Integration with external APIs

## API Endpoints

### `POST /chat`
Send a message to the chatbot
```json
{
    "message": "How do I register for classes?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "response": "You can register for classes through...",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
}
```

### `GET /health`
Check if the service is running
```json
{
    "status": "healthy"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **NLTK Data Not Found**
   - The app automatically downloads required NLTK data
   - If issues persist, manually run: `python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('all')"`

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`

3. **Database Issues**
   - Delete `chatbot.db` to reset the database
   - The app will recreate it with default data

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced NLP**: Integration with spaCy or transformers
- **Voice Interface**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Conversation insights and metrics
- **Integration**: Connect with student information systems
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications
